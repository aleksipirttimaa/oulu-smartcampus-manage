# Front-end

- AngularJS + Bootstrap (from ng-bootstrap) + Leaflet

## Environment

Currently using node 16 and npm 8.

It is assumed that you have installed the appropriate version of angular command line utilites globally:

(example for angular 13)

```sh
sudo npm i @angular/cli@13 -g
```

You should then be able to invoke `ng`

```sh
ng --version
```

you may however prefer to invoke ng without installing it:

```sh
npx @angular/cli@13 --version
```

## Tasks

- Actually implement flashmessage -service and component
- Improve this list
